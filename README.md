### EzRead
Students in technical and scientific disciplines often struggle to read
textbooks that are systematically overfilled with examples and proofs of reasonings. To aid in
applications of reading where only general concepts need to be understood, EzRead will
provide a modern deep learning solution that delivers streamlined summarizations of text that
can be used as in place of a guide for reading, or as a helpful aid during post reading reflection.




### Current Progress
The current state of this github repo can be explained in the following. There are two parallel efforts going on, one to aim for text summarizing using strictly historical techniques, 
and another using deep learning. 

IniNetwork, is a sequence2sequence network modified from exisiting open source code and frameworks and aims t0 give a unique summary.

SampleTech is a traditional approach using pattern recognition and weighs, and reuses existing sentences to form a summary. 

Currently they are only set up as runnable scripts and are hardcoded with script data, subject to change.
